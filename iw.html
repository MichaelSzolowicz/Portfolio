                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    I helped developers to build future entries in the Call of Duty franchise during my time at 
                    Infinity Ward. The internship lasted twelve weeks during the Summer of 2024. 
                    During that time I developed a new tool while learning various technologies to deliver 
                    improved workflows for game designers. This page will explain in detail what I did, the 
                    techniques used to do it, who I worked with, and why it was done.

                <h2>What</h2>
                <p>
                    Activision embeds interns within teams working towards measurable goals. 
                    I assumed several responsibilities during my time on the tools team. 
                    Starting out, to familiarize myself with the codebase, I added usability 
                    improvements like a keyboard shortcut to isolate log levels and migrated 
                    some buttons to a new backend call. After two weeks, given the choice between 
                    two larger features to focus the rest of my time on, I chose the one I saw 
                    as more challenging and interesting. It involved a new interface for selecting 
                    and running operations on certain collections of level content. Before leaving, 
                    I presented the results of my work in a digital symposium to the rest of the 
                    company. Activision also hosted various speakers and community events I partook in, 
                    but the above constitutes my core responsibilities.

                <h2>How</h2>
                <p>
                    I used my own problem solving and help from the vast expertise of Infinity Ward’s developers 
                    to complete my tool. Studio leadership had a vision for this tool before I arrived, 
                    while the details of implementation were up to me. I used Qt for Python and a 
                    proprietary Python library, which added additional functionality to Qt, to develop 
                    the interface for my tool. I developed a new subclass of tree view-model, and with 
                    help from a senior programmer adapted our proprietary library to support it. The 
                    tree view had to be synced with a second 2D graphic view, which I achieved with 
                    event driven architecture. Multithreading operations were used to asynchronously 
                    load data, which kept the application responsive. I also optimized calls made to 
                    the game engine, which required editing C++ engine code. More problems than I can 
                    list here needed to be solved, but none were solved entirely in isolation.

                <h2>Who</h2>
                <p>
                    I worked with the talented developers across Infinity to learn about the broader 
                    industry functions while implementing my tool. I watched people in departments outside 
                    the tools office use my tool for their first time to acquire feedback. Then discussed 
                    my observations with the tool engineering and tools UX leads, informing the tool’s 
                    design evolution. When I delved into unfamiliar code, like our proprietary library or 
                    the engine C++, I reached out to senior authors from departments like pipeline and 
                    engine development, who often worked at entirely different studios. All my code was 
                    subject to code reviews, receiving comments on optimization, bugs, and style from the 
                    rest of the tools team. I even provided my own input on other tools developers’ code. 
                    While the final implementation of my tool was dependent on my technical problem solving, 
                    it would not have been nearly as polished if I had not exercised my soft skills to gain 
                    insight from the wider studio.

                <h2>Why</h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of the internship was for me to learn while delivering something of value to 
                    the studio. Interns all had projects pertinent to actually shipping new titles, but growth 
                    and career development were just as big a focus. The tool I implemented focused on reducing 
                    iteration times for designers working on future Call of Duty titles. My work streamlined 
                    an interface making it easier to parse information and optimized some choke points. Most 
                    importantly, it made a new workflow for level development that is part of a broader studio 
                    initiative more accessible and fun. In terms of my own growth, I gained technical skills 
                    in view-model programming, multithreaded applications, perforce source control, and 
                    communication between multiple pieces of software. I also learned how to work with 
                    leadership and users. Overall my goals for the internship were well met, leaving myself 
                    and the team satisfied with the results.

                <p>
                    In succinct terms, that is the what, how, who, and why of my tools internship. Hopefully 
                    this gave you more insight into the nature of my work, the technologies, and who I made 
                    with and for. Feel free to reach out if you have  further questions.
